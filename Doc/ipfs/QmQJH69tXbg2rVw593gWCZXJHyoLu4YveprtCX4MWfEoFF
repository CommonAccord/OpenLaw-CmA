2.4.Sec=Each {Seller} agrees that this Section {7.2}, including the provisions relating to duration, geographical area, and scope, is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve {Buyer}'s and {the_Acquired_Companies}' legitimate business interests and the value of {the_Shares} and {the_Acquired_Companies}, and to prevent an unfair advantage from being conferred on any {Seller}.

3.1.1.Sec=all information that is a Trade Secret

3.1.2.Sec=all information concerning [[Org_ABA/MSPA_V2.Agt.Conf.Subject.Tech.cl]]

3.2.Sec=Each {Seller} acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the {Confidential_Information} and agrees that such {Seller} shall, except to the extent required for a {Seller} who is employed by an {Acquired_Company} to fulfill his or her duties in the course of such employment, from and after {the_Closing}:  (i) keep the {Confidential_Information} confidential and deliver promptly to {Buyer}, or immediately destroy at {Buyer}'s option, all embodiments and copies of the {Confidential_Information} that are in such {Seller}'s possession; (ii) not use the {Confidential_Information} for any reason or purpose; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the {Confidential_Information} to any {Person}, except with {Buyer}'s {Consent}.

3.3.Sec=Section {7.3(b)} does not apply to that part of the {Confidential_Information} that becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a {Breach} of this Section {7.3} by any {Seller}.  {Confidential_Information} shall not be deemed "generally available to the public" merely because it is included or incorporated in more general information that is publicly available or because it combines features which individually may be publicly available.

3.4.Sec=If any {Seller} becomes compelled in any {Proceeding} to make any disclosure that is prohibited by this Section {7.3}, such {Seller} shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide {Buyer} with prompt notice of such compulsion so that {Buyer} may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section {7.3}.  In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such {Seller} may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the {Confidential_Information} that, based upon the opinion of such {Seller}'s counsel, such {Seller} is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such {Seller} shall use its best efforts to obtain written assurance that any {Person} to whom any {Confidential_Information} is so disclosed shall accord confidential treatment to such {Confidential_Information}.

3.5.Sec=Nothing in this Section {7.3} will diminish the protections and benefits under applicable {Legal_Requirements} to which any Trade Secret of any {Acquired_Company} is entitled.  If any information that an {Acquired_Company} asserts to be a Trade Secret under applicable {Legal_Requirements} is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a Trade Secret, such information will nonetheless be considered {Confidential_Information} of that {Acquired_Company} for purposes of this Section {7.3}.
