Part {3.13(a)} identifies as such any {Employee_Plan} that is (x) a plan intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of {the_Code} or (y) a plan subject to Title IV of {ERISA}.  Other than the {Acquired_Companies}, no corporation or trade or business has ever been controlled by, controlling, or under common control with any {Seller} within the meaning of Section 414 of {the_Code} or Section 4001(a)(14) or 4001(b) of {ERISA}.

EmpBenefit.2.Sec={Sellers} have delivered to {Buyer} copies of (i) the documents comprising each {Employee_Plan} (or, with respect to an {Employee_Plan} which is unwritten, a detailed written description of eligibility, participation, benefits, funding arrangements, assets, and any other matters that relate to the obligations of any {Acquired_Company} thereunder); (ii) all trust agreements, insurance contracts, or any other funding instruments related to each {Employee_Plan}; (iii) all rulings, determination letters, no-action letters, or advisory opinions from the {IRS}, the United States Department of Labor, or any other {Governmental_Body} that pertain to each {Employee_Plan} and any open requests therefor; (iv) the most recent actuarial and financial reports (audited and/or unaudited) and the annual reports filed with any {Governmental_Body} with respect to each {Employee_Plan} during the current year and each of the three preceding years; (v) all {Contracts} with third-party administrators, actuaries, investment managers, consultants, or other independent contractors that relate to each {Employee_Plan}; and (vi) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications and memoranda, employee handbooks, and other written communications regarding each {Employee_Plan}.

EmpBenefit.3.Sec=Except as set forth in Part {3.13(c)}, all amounts owed by any {Acquired_Company} under the terms of any {Employee_Plan} have been timely paid in full.  Except as set forth in Part 3.13(c), each {Employee_Plan} that provides health or welfare benefits is fully insured, and any incurred but not reported claims under each such {Employee_Plan} that is not fully insured have been properly accrued.  Each {Acquired_Company} has paid in full all required insurance premiums, subject only to normal retrospective adjustments in the {Ordinary_Course_of_Business}, with regard to each {Employee_Plan}.

EmpBenefit.4.Sec=Each {Acquired_Company} has complied with the applicable continuation requirements for each {Employee_Plan}, including (i) Section 4980B of {the_Code} (as well as its predecessor provision, Section 162(k) of {the_Code}) and Sections 601 through 608, inclusive, of {ERISA} ("{COBRA}") and (ii) any applicable state {Legal_Requirements} mandating welfare benefit continuation coverage for employees.

EmpBenefit.5.Sec=The form of each {Employee_Plan} is in compliance with the applicable terms of {ERISA}, {the_Code}, and any other applicable {Legal_Requirement}, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and each {Employee_Plan} has been operated in compliance with such {Legal_Requirements} and the written {Employee_Plan} documents.  No {Acquired_Company} and no fiduciary of an {Employee_Plan} has violated the requirements of Section 404 of {ERISA}.  Each required report and description of an {Employee_Plan} (including {IRS} Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions, and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (to the extent required) timely filed with the {IRS}, the United States Department of Labor, or other {Governmental_Body} and distributed as required, and all notices required by {ERISA} or {the_Code} or any other {Legal_Requirement} with respect to each {Employee_Plan} have been appropriately given.  No {Acquired_Company} has any unfunded liability with respect to any deferred compensation, retirement, or other {Employee_Plan}.

EmpBenefit.6.Sec=Each {Employee_Plan} that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of {the_Code} has received, or is based on a form of plan that has received, a favorable determination letter from the {IRS}, which is current, taking into account the Tax laws referred to as "GUST."  To the {Knowledge} of {Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter.  Each trust created under any such {Employee_Plan} has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of {the_Code}, and, to the {Knowledge_of_Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in a revocation of such exemption.  No {Employee_Plan} is intended to meet the requirements of {Code} Section 501(c)(9).  No circumstance exists that could give rise to a loss of any intended tax consequence or to any Tax under Section 511 of {the_Code} with respect to any {Employee_Plan}.

Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in the assessment of a Tax or penalty under Section 4975 of {the_Code} or Section 502(l) of {ERISA} or result in a violation of Section 406 of {ERISA}.

EmpBenefit.08.Sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), obligate any {Acquired_Company} to pay any separation, severance, termination, or similar benefit to, or accelerate the time of vesting for, change the time of payment to, or increase the amount of compensation due to, any director, employee, officer, former employee, or former officer of any {Acquired_Company}.  There is no {Contract} providing for payments that could subject any {Person} to liability under Section 4999 of {the_Code}.

EmpBenefit.09.Sec=Other than the continuation coverage requirements of {COBRA}, no {Acquired_Company} has any obligation or potential liability for benefits to employees, former employees, or their dependents following termination of employment or retirement under any {Employee_Plan}.

EmpBenefit.10.Sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in an amendment, modification, or termination of any {Employee_Plan}.  No written or oral representation has been made to any employee or former employee of any {Acquired_Company} promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life, or disability coverage for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the extent of coverage required under {COBRA}).  No written or oral representation has been made to any employee or former employee of any {Acquired_Company} concerning the employee benefits of {Buyer}.

EmpBenefit.11.Sec=No {Acquired_Company} contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of {ERISA} that is a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of {ERISA}.

EmpBenefit.12.Sec=No {Acquired_Company} contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of {ERISA} or Section 414(f) of {the_Code} or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control within the meaning of Section 413(c) of {the_Code}.

EmpBenefit.13.Sec=Except as set forth in Part 3.13(m), no {Employee_Plan} is subject to Section 409A of {the_Code}.  Each {Employee_Plan} subject to Section 409A of {the_Code} ("Deferred Compensation Plan") complies in all material respects with Section 409A of {the_Code}.  No {Acquired_Company} has (i) granted to any {Person} an interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan that is, or upon the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest will be, subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of {the_Code}, or (ii) materially modified any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could cause an interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4) of {the_Code}.
