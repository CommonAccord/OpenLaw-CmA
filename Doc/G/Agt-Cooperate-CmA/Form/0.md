Doc.Ti=Cooperation Agreement

Why.Secs=The {_parties} wish to provide for orderly relations among themselves, to promote collaboration and reduce misunderstandings or conflicts (the "{_Purpose}").

Note=The sections are organized into four top-level headings, following the Focus/Def/Relate/Misc pattern of most interesting to most background.  "Why" is the recitals introduction.  Here the "deal" is confidentiality, a subject that would often appear as part of Relate.  First the links to the sections, then the list of the sections, then some mechanics for linking cross-references and the like.
